Valuereporter
=============

Valuereporter will show you which services your application actually are using, in production.
The Valuereporter-Agent will observe what classes, and methods are being used. This information
will be forwarded to this service, the Valuereporter.

Valuereporter will create statistics on usage, and present them in an intuitive GUI.

In the near future, Value reporter will also be able to:
- Show you which classes and methods that are NOT being used.
- Show you services that are offline.
- Show you the value generated by each of your services.

Installation
===================

java -jar Valuereporter-with-deps.jar

Database
